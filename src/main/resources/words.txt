time
is
another
important
ingredient
of
streaming
applications
most
event
streams
have
inherent
time
semantics
because
each
event
is
produced
at
a
specific
point
in
time
moreover
many
common
stream
computations
are
based
on
time
such
as
windows
aggregations
sessionization
pattern
detection
and
time-based
joins
an
important
aspect
of
stream
processing
is
how
an
application
measures
time
ie
the
difference
of
event
time
and
processing
time
